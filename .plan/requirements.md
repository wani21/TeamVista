# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Team Productivity Dashboard backend is a Spring Boot REST API that enables managers to track team tasks and productivity metrics. The system provides authentication, task management, and analytics capabilities for teams with role-based access control (managers and employees).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register and login to the system, so that I can access the dashboard with appropriate permissions based on my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration data (name, email, password, role) THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with BCrypt-hashed password
2. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the email is already in use
3. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token for subsequent authenticated requests
4. WHEN a user submits invalid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
5. IF a user has a valid JWT token THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user for protected endpoints
6. WHEN the system processes requests THEN it SHALL allow CORS requests from http://localhost:3000

### Requirement 2: Task Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to create and manage tasks for team members, so that I can assign work and track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager creates a task with title, description, status, priority, dueDate, and assignedTo THEN the system SHALL persist the task with a createdAt timestamp
2. IF a non-manager user attempts to create a task THEN the system SHALL return an authorization error
3. WHEN a manager updates a task THEN the system SHALL save the changes and return the updated task
4. WHEN a user retrieves a specific task by ID THEN the system SHALL return the task details including assigned user information
5. WHEN a user requests the task list THEN the system SHALL return all tasks with optional filtering by assignedTo and status query parameters

### Requirement 3: Task Status Updates

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to update the status of my assigned tasks, so that I can communicate my progress to the team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee updates the status of their assigned task THEN the system SHALL save the status change
2. IF an employee attempts to update a task not assigned to them THEN the system SHALL return an authorization error
3. WHEN a user marks a task as completed via the complete endpoint THEN the system SHALL set status to COMPLETED and record the completedDate
4. WHEN a manager updates any task THEN the system SHALL allow the update regardless of assignment

### Requirement 4: Dashboard Analytics

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to view productivity metrics and task statistics, so that I can assess team performance and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests the dashboard summary THEN the system SHALL return totalTasks count
2. WHEN a user requests the dashboard summary THEN the system SHALL return completedTasks count
3. WHEN a user requests the dashboard summary THEN the system SHALL return pendingTasks count (PENDING + IN_PROGRESS)
4. WHEN a user requests the dashboard summary THEN the system SHALL calculate and return onTimeCompletionPercent (tasks completed by or before dueDate)
5. WHEN a user requests the dashboard summary THEN the system SHALL return productivityScores per user (ratio of completed tasks to assigned tasks)

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and Initialization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use an in-memory database with sample data, so that I can quickly run and test the application without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use H2 in-memory database as the default data store
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the database with 2 users (1 manager, 2 employees)
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the database with 6 tasks with varied statuses and due dates
4. IF the application.properties is configured for MySQL THEN the system SHALL support MySQL as an alternative database

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and API Responses

**User Story:** As a client application developer, I want consistent error responses in JSON format, so that I can handle errors gracefully in the UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during request processing THEN the system SHALL return a JSON error response with appropriate HTTP status code
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with error details
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized with error message
4. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden with error message
5. WHEN a resource is not found THEN the system SHALL return a 404 Not Found with error message

### Requirement 7: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, readable code with clear structure, so that the codebase is easy to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow clear naming conventions and package structure
2. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL include short, helpful comments for complex logic
3. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL use explicit getters and setters (no Lombok) for clarity
4. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL separate concerns into appropriate layers (controller, service, repository, model, dto, config)
5. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL be simple and human-readable, avoiding clever one-liners
